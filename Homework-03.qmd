## Problem 1: personal data

#### a. data summarization

The data could be summarized by comparing my observations of the response variable, hours asleep, to the type of workout I did on that day such as legs, push, or pull, to better understand if a different type of workout changes my sleep schedule, and can be completed by creating a boxplot. I can also compare sleep to other variables such as calories eaten that day, workout duration, time of workout, and screen time by creating a scatterplot of the data to compare.

#### **b. Visualization**

Using the summary you described in part a, **create a visualization of your data comparing your summarized response variable between groups**. If you are calculating a mean or median, show the underlying data in addition to your summary.

```{r}
STATS_workout_data_Sheet1_2 <- read_csv("~/Downloads/STATS workout data - Sheet1-2.csv")

workout_data <- STATS_workout_data_Sheet1_2
screen_data <- workout_data |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  rename(day = day_of_the_week) |>
  select(day, asleep, screen_time)


workout_clean <- workout_data |> 
  clean_names() |>
  rename(day = day_of_the_week, work_time = duration_of_workout) |>  
  select(day, asleep,exercise_type)

workout_01 <- workout_data |> 
  clean_names() |>
  rename(day = day_of_the_week, work_time = duration_of_workout) |>  
  select(day, asleep,exercise_type, work_time)

workout_legs <- workout_clean |> 
  filter(exercise_type == "Legs")
```

```{r, ggplots}
#affective visualization
ggplot(workout_clean, 
       aes(x = asleep, y = exercise_type, fill = exercise_type)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
   scale_fill_manual(values = PNWColors::pnw_palette("Bay", 5))+
  labs(x = "Sleep (Hours)",
       y = "Exercise",
       title = "Workout Data",
       caption = "Evan's Gym Plot")

ggplot(workout_clean,
       aes(x = exercise_type,
           y = asleep,
           color = exercise_type)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x = "Exercise",
       y = "Time Asleep",
       title = "Workout Data",
       caption = "Evan's Gym Plot")

#screen time vs time asleep
ggplot(screen_data, aes(x = screen_time, 
                        y = asleep)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkslategray",
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = TRUE,
              color = "tomato") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Screen Time and Sleep Time",
    caption = "evans data",
    x = "Screen Time (hours/day)",
    y = "Time Asleep (hours/day)") +
  theme_classic()

#plot with x = workout duration, y = sleep, and shape = type of workout
ggplot(workout_01, 
       aes(x = asleep, y = work_time, color = exercise_type))+
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.7)+
  theme()+
   scale_color_manual(values = PNWColors::pnw_palette("Shuksan2", 4))
```

Use colors in your figure (that are not the default ggplot settings).

Make sure your axis labels are full, readable text (not just your column names).

#### **c. Caption (5 points)**

Write a *caption* for your figure.

#### **d. Table presentation (10 points)**

Using `gt` or `flextable`, create a table with the same data summary that you describe in part a and visualized in part b. For example, if you described and visualized means, make a table with means. If you need to, round any numbers to one decimal point.

```{r}
workout_data |> gt()
```

## **Problem 2. Affective visualization (24 points)**

In this problem, you will create an **affective visualization** using your personal data in preparation for workshops during weeks 9 and 10.

In lecture, we talked about the three vertices of data visualization: 1) exploratory, 2) affective, and 3) communicative. We’ve done a lot of exploratory and communicative visualization, but have yet to think about affective visualization.

#### **a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data (3-5 sentences). (2 points)**

An affective visualization is a visualization that has provokes emotion in the viewer using creativity and novelty. For my personal data on whether type of workout impacts sleep, a possibility can be to use the website From Data to Viz to find interesting ways to display the data, like using the ggridge package and creating a ridge plot for the data.

#### **b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea.**

#### **c. Make a draft of your visualization.**

```{r}
ggplot(workout_clean, 
       aes(x = asleep, y = exercise_type, fill = exercise_type)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
   scale_fill_manual(values = PNWColors::pnw_palette("Bay", 5))+
  labs(x = "Sleep (Hours)",
       y = "Exercise",
       title = "Workout Data",
       caption = "Evan's Gym Plot")
```

#### **d. Write an artist statement. (8 points)**

An artist statement gives the audience context to understand your work. For each of the following points, write 1-2 sentences to address:

-   the content of your piece (what are you showing?)

    I'm showing the relationship between my sleep and type of workout

-   the influences (what did techniques/artists/etc. did you find influential in creating your work?)

Influences for me was Jill Peltos paintings which combine data and beautiful visualizations that represent the real world applications. I also gathered influence from the website "from Data to Viz" which helped me find a way to express the data in a visually pleasing format.

-   the form of your work (written code, watercolor, oil painting, etc.)

The form of the work is written in code under c. make a draft of your visualization.

-   your process (how did you create your work?)

I created my work through R studio, and view the hills as elevation gains signifying the difficulty of the work, as you would on strava or any app tracking your runs.

## **Problem 3. Statistical critique**

#### **a. Revisit and summarize (6 points)**

What are the statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question? (Note: you have already written about this in homework 2! Find that text and provide it again here!)

The statistical tests they used were ANOVA test, "(ANOVA(1, 28): F023.52, P\<0.001)".

Insert the figure or table you described in Homework 2 here.

#### **b. Visual clarity (10 points)**

In 1-3 sentences, answer the question that best fits your paper.

If you inserted a figure in Part a: How clearly did the authors *visually* represent their statistics in figures? For example, are the x- and y-axes in a logical position? Do they show summary statistics (means and SE, for example) and/or model predictions, and if so, do they show the underlying data?

The figure visually represents the statistics well, the axis labels are in easy to view areas and the visual data is labelled clearly. The key is somewhat far from the data and your eyes have to wander far to view it. No summary statistics are shown.

#### **c. Aesthetic clarity (10 points)**

In 1-3 sentences, answer the question that best fits your paper.

If you inserted a figure in Part a: How well did the authors handle “visual clutter”? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio?

The authors have minimal visual clutter. They took a minimalist approach using greyscale color and simple labels with only two variables, while they could've included species richness and diversity into one table.

#### **d. Recommendations (can be longer than 4 sentences, 10 points)**

What recommendations would you make to make the figure or table better? What would you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications for each of your recommendations.

I recommend that the authors use color to make their visualizations pop and make it more easily digestible for the reader. If color is added, the reader can more clearly see what information the graphic is trying to represent. I would also move the legend closer to the data so the reader doesn't have to strain to see it.
